# What's is E-Mother? ü§®

We call this project E-Mother because Just like a mother care for us, they can give us all of their support we need. This website can also help with those things and support you if you have any problem. Like Mental Health, Daily Schedule , Routine and Healthy Habits, Productivity, Communication, Exercise and a whole lot more.
The role of our mother also determines how we communicate with others. This is especially true for how we communicate with our partners in our relationships, because, just like with affection, we witness how our parents communicate with each other and imitate it. Through learning our communication patterns from our parents‚Äô relationship, we also learn how to handle conflict. For better or for worse, the way our parents dealt with issues is likely to be the same way that we deal with issues in our romantic relationships as adults.
